        <p>University of Washington TCSS 360 Project
Conference Manager</p>

<p>A requirement for my Computer Science and System degree was a class that covered how to build a software system using standard development practices and representations. The class included writing user requirements, designing and representing computational units, rigorous program testing, reviews, 
inspections and demonstration of product. Working effectively in teams was essential in the success in this class. </p>

<p>The actual system developed was a desktop application that is used for managing academic conferences and papers. Multiple user-types could access the system with different roles; Program Chair, Author, Reviewer.</p>

<p>Author's could submit academic papers to conferences and then be assigned to Reviewers for review. Conference program chairs could then accept or reject the paper based of the Reviewers input. A flat-file system was used for saving the persistent data with the help of XML. Java was used as the programming language. </p>

<p>This project was a term long project working with a team of four. The roles of Facilitator and Scribe were rotated each week. During the meeting we assigned tasks for the week and at the end of the week we evaluated our team mates on how we worked together and achieved our goals. Our "client" was the 
professor who evaluated us on how we meet the requirements of the project. Since we rotated our assignments I was able to gain hands on experience of all of the Software Development Cycle. Our team was successful in finishing this project and able to demonstrate before the deadline.</p>
